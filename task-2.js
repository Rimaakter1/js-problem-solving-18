BMI Calculator and Health Category

Create a JavaScript program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and assigns a health category based on the BMI value. Use nested if-else statements to determine the health category.

    - Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2
    - BMI < 18.5, you are underweight.
    - BMI >= 18.5 and BMI <=24.9, you are normal.
    - BMI >=25 and BMI <= 29.9, you are overweight.
    - Otherwise, you are obese.

let height = 2;
let weight = 20;

let bmi = weight / height ^ 2;
console.log(bmi);


if (bmi < 18.5) {
    console.log("You are underweight");

}

else if (bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9)
    console.log("You are normal");

else if (bmi >= 25 && bmi <= 29.9) {
    console.log("You are overweight");

}

    console.log("you are obese");
